# ⚾ MLB Player Data Analysis (SQL + Power BI)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project explores **decades of MLB player data** using **SQL (MySQL)** and **Power BI**.  
The analysis focuses on:
- Schools that produced MLB players  
- Team salary spending over the years  
- Player career trajectories  
- Player attribute comparisons (height, weight, batting hand, etc.)  

The goal is to showcase **SQL querying, analytical thinking, and dashboard building skills**.
