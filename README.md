⚾ MLB Player Analytics Project

📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world scenario where I am hired as a Data Analyst Intern for Major League Baseball (MLB). The task is to analyze historical player data to uncover insights about player origins, team spending, career trajectories, and player attributes.

The dataset includes:

Player demographics (height, weight, debut year, etc.)
Schools attended
Salaries
Teams played for
The analysis was done using MySQL for querying and Power BI for visualization.

🎯 Business Questions

What schools do MLB players attend?
How much do teams spend on player salaries?
What does each player’s career look like?
How do player attributes compare?
